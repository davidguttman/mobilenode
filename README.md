# mobilenode

mobilenode is (errem... *will be*) a tiny node-like environment for native mobile apps.  Focus will initially be on iOS 7 using the JavaScriptCore framework, but maybe this thing can get rolling on Android some day.

Obviously, nothing to see here yet.  Check back in a month when I need to have a demo ready :)
